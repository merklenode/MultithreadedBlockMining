### Simple Version of the Multithreaded Blockchain Mining Project Overview

This project simulates a blockchain with multithreaded mining, using C++ and OpenSSL. The goal is to show how blockchain works and how multithreading can be used to mine blocks. The mining process uses the SHA-256 algorithm in a proof-of-work (PoW) system, where blocks are mined by multiple threads working at the same time.

### Key Features:
- **Multithreaded Mining**: Mining happens in parallel, with multiple blocks being mined at once.
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**: Each block needs a valid hash that starts with specific zeros, and this is found by adjusting the block’s nonce.
- **Blockchain Simulation**: Blocks are added one after another, with each one referencing the previous block.
- **Concurrency and Thread Safety**: Uses `std::mutex` to make sure the blockchain is safe to update when multiple threads are mining.

### Requirements:
- C++17 or higher
- OpenSSL for SHA-256 hashing
- CMake for building the project

### Dependencies:
- **OpenSSL**: For the SHA-256 algorithm. 
  - On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`
  - On macOS (using Homebrew): `brew install openssl`
- **C++17**: Make sure your C++ compiler supports C++17 (e.g., GCC 7+ or Clang 5+).

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multithreaded-blockchain-mining.git
   cd multithreaded-blockchain-mining
   ```
2. Create a build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
3. Run CMake to configure the build:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```
   If there are issues with OpenSSL, you can specify its location:
   ```bash
   cmake .. -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/openssl
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
5. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   ./MultithreadedBlockMining
   ```

### Usage:
The program simulates mining 5 blocks at the same time. The difficulty is set to 4, so the program mines blocks until their hashes start with 4 zeros. Each block has a nonce that changes until the block’s hash meets the required difficulty. After mining, the blockchain is printed with each block’s hash and nonce.

### Example Output:
```
Starting mining...
Block mined: 00001234abcd... (Nonce: 1024)
Block mined: 00005678efgh... (Nonce: 2048)
...
Blockchain:
Block 0 [Hash: 0000000abcdef1234...]
Block 1 [Hash: 00001234abcd...]
Block 2 [Hash: 00005678efgh...]
...
```

### Code Structure:
- **src/Block.h**: Defines the block class with its properties and methods.
- **src/Block.cpp**: Implements the logic for mining and calculating hashes.
- **src/Blockchain.h**: Defines the blockchain class that manages the blocks.
- **src/Blockchain.cpp**: Implements blockchain management and multithreaded mining.
- **src/main.cpp**: The main file that starts the mining process.

### Concurrency and Thread Safety:
The project uses multithreading to mine blocks at the same time. `std::mutex` ensures that only one thread can modify the blockchain at a time, making it safe when working with multiple threads.

### Future Improvements:
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Adjust the difficulty based on how quickly blocks are mined.
- **Other Mining Algorithms**: Add alternative algorithms like Proof-of-Stake or Proof-of-Authority.
- **Blockchain Visualization**: Show the blockchain in a graphical format.
- **Transaction Pool**: Let miners pick transactions to include in blocks.
- **Distributed Consensus**: Simulate decentralized blockchain operations.

### Architecture Overview:
- **Block Class**: Represents a single block with properties like hash, data, and nonce. It can mine itself by finding a valid hash.
- **Blockchain Class**: Manages the entire blockchain and adds blocks sequentially.
- **Multithreading**: Multiple threads mine blocks in parallel. `std::mutex` is used to ensure thread safety.

### Threading and Synchronization:
- **Multithreading**: Each thread mines one block at a time.
- **Thread Safety**: `std::mutex` makes sure that the blockchain is updated safely by one thread at a time.

This setup simulates a simple but efficient multithreaded blockchain mining system in C++.
